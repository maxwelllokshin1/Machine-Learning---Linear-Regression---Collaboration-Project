# Collaboration projects in Maxhine Learning

# Day 1
- Watched [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogLNsTrx_QQ) and went over the basics in a machine learning model.
- Used Linear regression to predict the salaray of a individual based on their years of experience.
- Gathered data from a CSV file and separated data based on test and training data and target data
- We used these X matrix containing the test and training data to separate into 80% training data and 20% testing data in order to train our linear regression model
- We used the y matrxi containing the target data in order to compare values from the model to the real data.
- Ploted values on scatter plot to visualize data better and got the R^2 and mean squared error values
- Since there wasn't enough data in the data set given to the model, R^2 value was larger than we wanted
- Finally from all this information we can test how much 10 years of experience would get you in salary
